##  Javascript, CSS, and HTML Working Together

HTML - the content layer
CSS - the presentation layer
Javascript - the behavior layer

### Objects and Methods

Document - the document object represents the entire web page.  All web browsers implement this obhject, and you can use it just by giving its name.

Write - the write() method of the document object allows new content to be written into the page where the -script- element sits.

- Ex.document.write('Good afternoon!')
- Document = document
- Method = write('Good afternoon!')
- Period(.) = Member Operator
- 'Good afternoon"' = Parameter.  Tells write what to write.

Javscript will run wherever HTML finds it in the coding
