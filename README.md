***Learning journal from 102***

My name is Yvette and I love to learn.  I also love movies, reading, and my dogs.  I have two daughters and I love them too.  They are gamers.  My *oldest daughter* :heart: will be getting her 10th tattoo soon and my **youngest daughter** :heart: will be getting her first soon.
