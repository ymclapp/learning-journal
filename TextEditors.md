## Choosing a Text Editor

Choosing a text editor is more personal preference and most importantly that you can get it to work for you consistently to create the outputs you want
What features should you look for in a text editor? Some of the most important features are: 
1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

Most computers come with an already installed Text Editor:
- Mac = Text Edit
- Windows = Notepad
- Linux = based on distro

These editors are usually the most basic, bare bones version of an editor.

Third Party Options:
- Notepad ++ - only for Windows
- TextWrangler - only for Macs - retired, but worked into BB Edit
- Visual Studio Code - Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux computers
- Atom - created by Github - Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux computers
- Brackets - created by Adobe - Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux computers
- Sublime Text

A text editor manages text, files, and folders.  IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package
