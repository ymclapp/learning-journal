## Learning from Read 07 Progrmming with Java Script

HTML Elements - add to the content of a page to describe structure
- Ex. -p class="fruit">peach-/p-
- class is the attribute name
- fruit is the attribute value

CSS Rules - indicate how the contents of one or more elements should be displayed in the browser
- Ex. .fruit {color: pink;}
- .fruit is the selector
- {color: pink;} is the declaration block
- color is the property name
- pink is the property value

A Script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.  Similar to a cook following a recipe.

To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it
- Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps
    - 1.  Define the goal/task you want to achieve
    - 2.  Design the sscript by splitting the goal/task out into a series of steps
    - 3.  Code each step, but spend the time designing your script before you actually start writing code

Vocabulary - The words that computers understand
Syntax - How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow

### Expressions
1.  Expressions that just assign a value to a variable = var color = 'beige';
2.  Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value = var area = 3 * 2;

### Operators
- Assignment operators - assign a value to a variable - ex. color = 'beige';
- Arithmetic operators - perform basic math - ex. area = 3 * 2;
- String operators - combine two strings - ex. greeting = 'Hi ' + 'Molly';
- Comparison operators - compare two values and return true or false - ex. buy = 3 > 5;
- Logical operators - combine expressions and return true or false - ex. buy = (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);

### Arithmetic Operators
- Addition = +
- Subtraction = -
- Division = /
- Multiplication = *
- Increment = ++
- Decrement = --
- Modulus = % - divides two values and returns the remainder

Order of execution is similar to normal math - multiplication and division first then left to right on addition and subtraction
