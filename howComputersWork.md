## How Computers Work Videos

My top three most significant learnings:
1. Bit - on/off - is one wire.  More wires will get you more options.
2. Binary Number System - for the regular numbering sysem, the fourth position is 1000.  In the BNS, it is 8.  Starts at 1, then goes up by 2s.  The fourth position is 8 then.  To get an answer of 9, there would be a 1 in the fourth and first position and 0s in the second and third positions.
3. Pictures/images are stored as numbers based on the colors in the pixels since the colors are assigned numbers.
