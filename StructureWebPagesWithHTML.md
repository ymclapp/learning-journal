## Deciding on a website design

There are many questions that can be asked.  Kind of like buying a car for the first time, someone is going to ask all of the questions to find out what you are looking for in a car.  Same thing with a website.  Additionally, what are you looking to get out of the website?  What do you want your audience to successfully do and you to successfully obtain from them.

First steps would be to find out who your audience is.  Specifically, their demographic and internet habits.

If it is a company that is your target audience, then you may want to know:
- What is the size of the company or relevant department?
- What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?
- Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?
- How large is the budget they control? 

What differentiates your site from all of those out there vying for the same attention or dollar?

A site map is a great tool.  Almost like a decison tree or file structure tree.  While you are developing your site, you can draft up how the site pages will lay out.  Essentially what you will click and will take you where.  Make sure to include things that will happen outside of what you see on the page too.  A database that captures information from the form shown on a page, for example.

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

Visual hierarchy refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first.

- Images create a high visual contrast and often attract the eye first

You can also group similar things to make comprehension by the audience easier.  Some of those are:
- Proximity - (visual is four blocks in a row) - When several items are placed close together, they are perceived as more related than items that are placed further apart. (You can also nest groups of information within larger groups of information.)

- Closure - (visual looked like Tetris) - When faced with a complicated arrangement of items, we will often look for a single or recognisable pattern or form. A real or imaginary box can be formed around elements due to their proximity and alignment.

- Continuance (visual is four blocks in a smile curve) - When elements are placed in a line or a curve then they are perceived to be more related than those that are not following the same direction. This can be used to direct a reader from one part of a page to the next.

- White Space - (visual is two sets of four blocks in a square with white space all the way around the two squares) - Placing related items closer together and leaving a bigger gap between unrelated items.

- Color - (visual is four blocks in a row with a colored border around the length and width) - A background color placed behind related items to emphasize their connection.

- Borders - (visual is four blocks in a row with a line border around the length of width) - A line can be drawn around the border of the group or between it and its neighbors.

### Navigation

Navigation is very important.  If your audience can't get to what they need/want, they will leave.

- Concise - quick and easy to read
- Clear - users should be able to predict the kind of information that they will find on the page before clicking on the link
- Selective - only reflect the sections or content of the site
- Context - shows where user is when on website.  Using a color in the menu to show the page they are on or a visual marker
- Interactive - the page selected in navigation should change color when clicked, appearance of the link should change when they hover over it, should be visually distinct from everything else on the page
- Consistent - keep the navigation bar items consistent across pages and into secondary pages
